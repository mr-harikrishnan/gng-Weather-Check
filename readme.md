This is a simple JavaScript project that displays all countries along with their flags. When you click on a country's flag, it fetches and shows the current temperature (in °C and °F) for that country using the WeatherAPI.

# Features
Fetches data for all countries using the REST Countries API.

Displays country name and flag in a card layout.

On clicking a flag, it fetches:

Current temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit.

The country's name (as detected by WeatherAPI).

Uses WeatherAPI to get real-time temperature data.

Simple and clean UI using JavaScript DOM manipulation.

#  APIs Used

# @REST Countries API - for country names and flags.

# @WeatherAPI - for current weather data.

# How It Works
